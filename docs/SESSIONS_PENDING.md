# Sessions Pending

Temporary worker append buffer. Main consolidates entries into `docs/SESSIONS_ARCHIVE.md` during closeout.

**For workers (Plan / Dev / Review):** Append your session entry at the end of this file. Use the same format as archive entries (`## Session N — Agent Type` with Artifacts, Summary, Outcome sections).

**For Main:** At the start of each session, read this file. If it contains entries, archive them to `docs/SESSIONS_ARCHIVE.md`, update `docs/SESSIONS.md` living summary, then rewrite this file with only this header.
