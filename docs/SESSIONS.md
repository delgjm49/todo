## Last Sessions

- **Session 210 — Main close** (2026-05-30): Closed dispatch 068 after Review PASS, consolidated Sessions 207–209, marked the channel closed, pushed the reviewed unit-test fix, and addressed the follow-on Windows bundle failure by including the existing `.ico` icon in Tauri config.
- **Session 209 — Review PASS** (2026-05-30): Reviewed and passed Windows CI Tauri unit fixes. Confirmed no text-cell clipboard global error suppressor/native controlled-input `KeyboardEvent` dispatch remains; targeted tests, full JS suite (442/442), and lint passed locally.
- **Session 208 — Dev** (2026-05-30): Removed the text-cell clipboard global error suppressor by extracting React key handling into `text-cell-key-down.ts` and testing it directly. Verified `alertScheduler.test.ts` passes locally; no alert scheduler product behavior changes.
- **Session 207 — Main dispatch** (2026-05-30): Dispatched focused Windows CI follow-up for the two failures left red after dispatches 066/067, with Tauri Windows CI green as the authoritative acceptance gate.
- **Session 206 — Review PASS** (2026-05-26): Re-reviewed and passed test warning cleanup. Full JS suite passes 442/442; lint clean; prior SaveStatusIndicator full-suite failure and useAlertNavigation cleanup issue fixed.
- **Session 205 — Dev Re-fix** (2026-05-26): Fixed pending autosave timer contamination in `saveStatusIndicator.test.tsx` and corrected `useAlertNavigation` cleanup to separately cancel rAF and timeout handles.
- **Session 204 — Review** (2026-05-26): Returned test warning cleanup to Dev for full-suite SaveStatusIndicator failure and timer cleanup correctness issue.
- **Session 203 — Dev** (2026-05-26): Reduced React/JSDOM warning noise from roughly ~382 to ~33 via test harness cleanup and `useAlertNavigation` teardown cleanup. Full suite passed in Dev.

## Next Recommended

**Full Planned v1 (MVP Core + Extended) plus TICKET-060 and TICKET-061 are now complete. Dispatch 068 has Review PASS for the remaining Tauri Windows CI unit-test blockers and includes the follow-on Tauri icon config fix needed for the Windows bundle step.**
