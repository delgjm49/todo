## Last Sessions

- **Session 244 — Main close** (2026-05-30): Closed dispatch 076 after Review PASS, consolidated Sessions 241–243, marked the channel closed, and prepared the timer-hygiene micro follow-up for commit/push.
- **Session 243 — Review PASS** (2026-05-30): Reviewed timer hygiene. Confirmed the rAF cancellation test now schedules zero real timers while preserving stale-rAF and second-result-selection assertions; test/lint/build passed.
- **Session 242 — Dev** (2026-05-30): Changed the rAF cancellation test to use a block-shaped second navigation target, avoiding the 300ms row-flash timer path.
- **Session 241 — Main dispatch** (2026-05-30): Dispatched Search navigation timer-test hygiene as a micro follow-up to dispatch 075.
- **Session 240 — Main close** (2026-05-30): Closed dispatch 075 after Review PASS WITH NOTES, consolidated Sessions 237–239, marked the channel closed, and prepared Search MVP hardening for commit/push.
- **Session 239 — Review PASS WITH NOTES** (2026-05-30): Reviewed Search test hardening. Verified explicit exclusion/order coverage and rAF cleanup; `npm run test` passed 453/453 plus lint/build. Deferred one deterministic timer-overlap hygiene note.
- **Session 238 — Dev** (2026-05-30): Added Search hardening tests for checkbox/bullet/numbered exclusions and multi-level ordering; tightened `useSearchNavigation` pending rAF/fallback cleanup.
- **Session 237 — Main dispatch** (2026-05-30): Dispatched Search MVP hardening follow-up after independent audit.

## Next Recommended

**Recommended next work: choose the next post-MVP product seed.** Search MVP and its hardening follow-ups are complete. The next dispatch should be a scoped planning pass or implementation kickoff for one of the remaining post-MVP candidates, with **richer date/time pickers** as the lowest-risk product improvement and **archive/completed views** as the higher-impact but higher-model-risk alternative.

Remaining in the broader v1 backlog:
- None.
